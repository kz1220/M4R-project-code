This Github repository acts as supplementary material to my thesis.


The file "Metropolis algorithm for the bivariate normal example" contains a function that implements Metropolis algorithm and the simulation code for Figure 2.1.
"SGLD paper gaussian experiment" contains 
"Fisher and AdaMALA on 2D Gaussian with Frobenius norm plot"
"Fisher and AdaMALA on Gaussian process target with Frobenius norm plot"
"Fisher and AdaMALA on inhomogeneous Gaussian target with Frobenius norm plot" 

The file "potential scale reduction and ESS function implemented on a bivariate normal example"
